This is my CircuitPython implementation of the VBand interface.

This runs on an Adafruit Feather RP2040, just because it was capable of running as an HID device, and I had it kicking around my parts bin with nothing better to do.  It's very overpowered for this application, but so be it.  
You could probably also get this running on another RP2040 board, such as the Rasberry Pi Pico.
